<!-- About Me Section -->
<section id="about-me">
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I’m Kaan Arda Uzun, a Computer Engineering graduate with a passion for securing digital landscapes and a clear focus on advancing my career in cybersecurity. While my technical journey began with a foundation in software development and iOS application building, my dedication has evolved into specializing in cybersecurity to protect systems and data from ever-evolving threats.</p>

    <p>My background includes hands-on experience in iOS development, where I created projects like a <strong>Spotify Clone</strong> app and <strong>EasyGYM</strong>, a fitness tracking app, using Swift, UIKit, MVVM, and various third-party libraries. These projects allowed me to understand complex application structures, strengthen my coding skills, and gain insight into delivering both functional and secure applications.</p>

    <p>Alongside development, I’ve gained valuable experience in Quality Assurance (QA) through internships where I collaborated on test case creation, managed projects using Jira, and documented best practices in software testing. My experience in QA has given me a solid grounding in testing methodologies, which aligns well with the analytical mindset required in cybersecurity.</p>

    <p>I am highly committed to developing a career in cybersecurity and have actively pursued this path through certifications and practical projects. To build my expertise, I’ve completed several bootcamps and certifications, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cisco CyberOps Associate</strong> – Cisco Networking Academy</li>
        <li><strong>Cyber Security Bootcamp</strong> – Garanti BBVA Güvenlik Akademisi</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Check out more in my <a href="certificates.html">certificates page</a>.</p>

    <p>Through these, I’ve gained skills in vulnerability assessment, threat detection, and incident response, and I regularly engage in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges to deepen my hands-on skills. I’m also working on practical cybersecurity projects, such as setting up honeypots and developing an Elastic SIEM lab, which enable me to simulate and analyze potential cyber threats. I’ve documented some of my learning in a Medium article titled <em>Elastic SIEM Lab Oluşturma Rehberi</em> and continuously strive to expand my knowledge of security tools and techniques.</p>

    <p>I am actively seeking opportunities that allow me to contribute in meaningful ways to the cybersecurity field, while also building on my QA and development background. With an analytical mindset, a proactive approach to learning, and a firm commitment to protecting digital environments, I am excited to bring my skills and passion for cybersecurity into a specialized, impactful role.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to <strong>open-source projects</strong> and collaborate with professionals in both the iOS development and cybersecurity communities. I’m excited to take on roles that will allow me to expand my technical expertise while making a meaningful contribution to the security of digital systems.</p>

    <p>Feel free to connect with me through my contact page or check out my <strong>GitHub</strong> to explore my projects. I’m always open to new ideas, collaborations, and learning opportunities. Let’s build something amazing together!</p>
